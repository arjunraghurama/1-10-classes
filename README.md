## Update
Welp. This site was hosted on Heroku free tier. Unfortunately starting from Nov, 2022 there wont be any free tier from Heroku. Hence taking the hosted app down. Leture videos are still available [here](./data/data.json)


## 2021-22 Video Lectures for 1-10th standard students (Karnataka State Board)

This repository contains all the video URLs for the lecture videos. Also the videos are available class-wise in this [site]().
